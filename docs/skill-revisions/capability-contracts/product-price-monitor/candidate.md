# Product Price Monitor

Monitor a concrete purchasable item and alert on a normalized all-in price or availability condition. Handle variants, taxes, fees, currencies, stock, cancellation terms, and duplicate alerts explicitly. A recurring watch requires an explicitly requested and verified schedule; do not assume an automation blueprint or job exists.

## When to Use

- "Alert me when this laptop drops below $1,000."
- "Watch these flights for a fare under $500."
- "Tell me when this hotel has a refundable room."
- "Track ticket/listing availability."
- A cron tick fires for an existing price watch (steps 4-6).

Don't use for: one-off "what does this cost right now" lookups (use `web_search`/`web_extract` directly).

## Procedure — Setup (foreground, once)

### 1. Define the exact item

Record source URL/provider, product/listing ID where available, variant, quantity, location, dates, travelers/guests, membership/login assumptions, condition, seller, and acceptable substitutes. Done when two variants cannot be confused.

### 2. Define the alert condition

Specify currency, all-in vs pre-tax price, maximum price, availability/stock rule, shipping, refundability, cabin/room/ticket class, cooldown, and notification destination. Done when synthetic examples have deterministic alert decisions.

### 3. Establish a live baseline, then schedule

Fetch a bounded live result with an available web fetch or browser tool after checking its current schema. Record retrieval time, source price, fees/taxes, availability and terms. Do not schedule until one foreground fetch works. Resolve the watch contract to the authorized active profile's `$HERMES_HOME/price-watches/<watch-slug>.json`; do not write to another profile's default home.

Inspect the native scheduler's current schema and existing jobs before creating a duplicate. Resolve cadence, timezone, delivery destination and the absolute contract path; the future job prompt must stand alone. Pick a cadence that respects rate limits and site terms. Read back the exact schedule, authorized profile, prompt and destination. A successful create response alone does not verify monitoring.

## Procedure — Tick (each scheduled run)

### 4. Fetch and normalize

Re-fetch the source. Convert currency only with a timestamped rate and retain the source currency. Separate base price, mandatory fees, shipping/taxes, total, and availability. Exclude volatile page metadata. A failed fetch means unknown state: report or skip, but never overwrite the last good observation with an error page. Done when the observation is comparable to the baseline or explicitly marked failed.

### 5. Compare and suppress duplicates

Alert on threshold entry, qualifying availability, material lower price, or recovery as requested. Store the last good observation separately from delivery state. Commit the last delivered alert fingerprint only after a verified delivery; inspect ambiguous sends before retrying so failures do not lose or duplicate alerts. Replaying the same offer must send no second alert; respect the cooldown. Done when the alert decision is deterministic against stored state.

### 6. Deliver or stay silent

When a condition is met, the alert includes: exact item/variant, observed all-in price and source currency, availability/terms, threshold, retrieval timestamp, source link, and important uncertainty. Never claim inventory is reserved. When nothing qualifies, stay silent — no "still watching" noise unless a periodic all-clear was requested. Keep an explicit watch-health policy for repeated collection/delivery failures; silence is not proof of success. Never buy, book or reserve anything as part of monitoring. Done when the state update and any required delivery are verified.

## Pitfalls

- Comparing a base fare with an all-in threshold.
- Alerting on the wrong size, seller, cabin, dates, or room terms.
- Overwriting a last-known-good value with an error page.
- Polling aggressively enough to trigger blocking or violate site terms.
- Scheduling before a single foreground fetch has succeeded.

## Verification

- [ ] The watch contract pins the item so two variants cannot be confused.
- [ ] One foreground fetch succeeded before any job was created.
- [ ] Alert decisions replay deterministically from the state file; duplicates suppressed.
- [ ] Failed fetches never replaced last-known-good state.
- [ ] Alerts carry all-in price, source currency, timestamp, and source link.
